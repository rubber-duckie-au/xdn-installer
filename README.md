# xdn-installer

Bash script for installing DigitalNote masternode (v2.0.0.6 ONLY)

NOTE: Can be run as root or user, however some tasks will require sudo, so if run as user [sudo] will prompt for password
```
git clone https://github.com/rubber-duckie-au/xdn-installer.git
cd xdn-installer
bash xdn-installer.sh
```
NOTE: Script can now support installing of additional MNs on the same server - MUST BE RUN UNDER A DIFFERENT USER (I know there is other ways, but this is what this script does...)
